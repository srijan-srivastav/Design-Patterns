## Adapter Pattern
An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.

The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects. It's usually implemented once the application is designed.

Consider a scenario in which there is an app that's developed in the US which returns the top speed of luxury cars in miles per hour (MPH). Now we need to use the same app for our client in the UK that wants the same results but in kilometers per hour (km/h).

To deal with this problem, we'll create an adapter which will convert the values and give us the desired results
